## 📜 Description
This repository contains a project for creating an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server from scratch using Python. MCP is used in AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) to handle context and model interactions. The main objective is to demonstrate how to build a server that can handle MCP packets, allowing users to connect and interact with the server efficiently.

## 🚀 Features
- 🛠️ **Custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) Handling**
- 🔄 **Packet Parsing and Serialization**
- ⚙️ **Multiplayer Server Capabilities**
- 📝 **Detailed Documentation**

## 🛠️ Current Features
- Custom packet handling
- Context management
- Basic model integration
- Communication system

## 📅 Future Updates
- Advanced context management
- Model training support
- Full command system
- Plugin support

## 🛠️ Installation
To install and run the server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/KunjShah95/MCP-SERVER-FROM-SCRATCH-USING-PYTHON.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd MCP-SERVER-FROM-SCRATCH-USING-PYTHON
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the server:
    ```
    python server.py
    ```
